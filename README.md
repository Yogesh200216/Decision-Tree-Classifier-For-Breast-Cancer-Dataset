# Decision-Tree-Classifier-For-Breast-Cancer-Dataset

This project provides a Decision Tree Classifier for classifying breast cancer into benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The classifier is built using the scikit-learn library in Python.

# Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is a publicly available dataset that has been collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg of the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. It contains 569 instances of malignant and benign tumor cells. The features include the following:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

# Evaluation
The Decision Tree Classifier has been evaluated on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and has achieved an accuracy of approximately 91%.
